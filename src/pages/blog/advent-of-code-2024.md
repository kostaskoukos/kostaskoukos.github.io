# Advent of Code 2024

> Happy new year!!! May 2025 be a good and productive year for all of us!

I am excited to tell you that I have started tackling the advent of code 2024 challenges! I have always wanted to participate in this event, but never had the time to do so. Having completed the first 7 (out of 25) days, I can say I have been enjoying it quite a lot!

## Rust: the language of 2025

A lot of people choose new languages to solve AoC, in order to become more familiar with them, and I am no exception. In my opinion, Rust is a very versatile language and also an unknown one for me, so it was the perfect choice. Also, I plan to dive head first into functional programming languages and concepts in 2025, including category theory (fear the almighty _Monad_).

## The challenges

AoC challenges aren't particularly hard, just tricky, imo, regarding the usage of Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge. The first few problems were quite easy and were a perfect opportunity to get used to Rust's standard library, as far as IO and data input is concerned. It was also easy to apply functional programming concepts in this "low stakes" environment.

## My solutions

I am not particularly proud of my solutions, but the work so it's OK. You can see my crappy code [here](https://github.com/kostaskoukos/aoc2024). Contributions and suggestions (there have to be a lot) are welcome!

I hope 2025 will be a year of growth, productivity and goals being achieved for everyone. Bye for now!
