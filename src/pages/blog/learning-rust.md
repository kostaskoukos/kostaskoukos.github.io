# Learning Rust

Lately I have been meaning to try Rust, both because it's all the rage nowadays, and because I wanted to learn a systems language, without touching C/C++.

## First Impressions

Rust has great tooling, cargo is very nice, but the compile times even for a demo program are too long. I am fan of functional programming, which rust blends superbly with traditional imperative programming. The syntax is ok, **very** different from JS/TS syntax

## Projects I want to build with Rust

- Chess board, with chess rules and nice UI (yes, I am a chess enthusiast :) )
- Web server, maybe even something with websockets, like a live polling web app
- A CLI, but I haven't thought about this one yet

## Closing Thoughts

Rust is a very promising language, but the steep learning curve is something I will try hard to surpass!
