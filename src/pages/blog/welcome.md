# Hello World!

This my first blog post and I welcome you to my little writing area!

## A little about myself

I am a Greek 17 year-old guy learning programming all by myself. I know I have lots to learn, however I will be documenting my journey, both for my personal reflection and for anyone to see it.

## What will this blog be about

Pretty much anything I can come up with. Learning is a rough process so please do not expect this to be anything professional or something. You can contact me however you like because we all constantly hear that networking is very important in tech so let's link up!

> _This post is getting pretty boring so I will end here..._

Goodbye and happy coding to everyone!
