Don't mind me, I am Just experimenting with [KaTeX](https://katex.org) and remark/rehype plugins!

**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
Let $f:[a,b] \to \R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F:[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=
\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$.
Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$,
$F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.

$$
\text{f is continuous} \iff f(x_0)=\lim_{x \to x_0^+}{f(x)} = \lim_{x \to x_0^-}{f(x)}
\\[1em]
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{e^{-x^2}}dx = \sqrt{\pi}
\\[1em]
\frac{\partial{W}}{\partial{b}} = \sum_{i=0}^{N}{L_i}
\\[1em]
\text{Riemann $\zeta$ function: } \; \zeta (s) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty{\dfrac{1}{i^s}},\; s \in \mathbb{C}
